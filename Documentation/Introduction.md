# ArchiveIt
ArchiveIt is an open-source program designed to allow organizations to organize, track, and compartmentalize their various collections and equipment.  While ArchiveIt is intended to be used for collections such as museums, libraries, and personal collections, it can also be used for other types of tracking such as inventory.

## Basic Concepts
ArchiveIt primarily wraps around an SQL database that encapsulates the various collections and individual objects contained within it, but in a far more intuitive way.  The highest level unit in ArchiveIt is a Collection, which contains individual objects as well as identifying information such as its owner/department, its location, and any other information that the user wishes to add.

Individual items are stored as Objects, which can include anything that the user wishes to track such as books, specimens, etc.

## Can I Have Multiple Archives?
ArchiveIt can handle as many archives as you want, and stores them all on your local machine.  Importing archives to a new machine is as simple as copying the files or connecting to the remote database.

## Can I Run Archives Off A Server?
ArchiveIt can handle both local and remote archives, as long as the remote archives are properly formatted.

## How Do I Start?
Currently the program is not in a functional state, and therefore cannot be built.  Check back regularly to know when the program is finished.

## How Do I Contribute?
This program is currently maintained solely by one person, and I currently don't accept donations as I have no need for them.  If you would like to contribute to the codebase, feel free to fork and contribute.  I cannot guarantee a timeline for when it will be viewed, but I will try.

Other options for contribution are by opening issues or feature requests whenever you come across one, as I always try to prioritize those.
